It is usually smoked and produces an immediate and intense euphoria, but the high is short-lived and is often followed by a crash. Crack cocaine is illegal in most countries and can lead to serious health problems, including addiction, stroke, and increased risk of heart attack. It is also associated with violent behavior and can lead to financial and social problems.",
