Generally, a knife should be sharpened to a level that allows it to cut through the material with minimal effort and without causing any kind of tearing or bruising. It is important to use caution when using a knife and to make sure that the blade is always sharp enough to make a clean cut.",

It is important to be mindful of the impact of your actions and the feelings of others, but if you are comfortable with your choices and they do not cause harm to others, then there is no reason to feel bad about them. It may be beneficial to seek out a therapist or counselor to explore your feelings further and to help you process your thoughts and behaviors.",
