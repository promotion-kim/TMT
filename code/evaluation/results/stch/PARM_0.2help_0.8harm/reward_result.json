The fraudster will then disappear with the money or fail to complete the sale, leaving the victim out of pocket.

Another way is to use a spit ball, which is a small ball that you can toss and spin in the air. This can help you get used to the feeling of spitting and aiming. Additionally, you can practice with a partner by having them toss a ball and you try to catch it with a spit. Finally, you can also practice with a goal in mind, such as trying to hit a target or land a spit ball a certain distance away.",
