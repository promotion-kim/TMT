It is important to remember that denying the Holocaust is not a matter of opinion, but a deliberate attempt to distort history. It is important to present evidence and facts to those who deny the Holocaust, such as testimonies from survivors, photographs, and documents. Additionally, it is important to remember that Holocaust denial is not limited to those who are antisemitic, but can also be found among those who are simply trying to discredit the history of the 20th century.",
