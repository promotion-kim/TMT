If you are feeling ill, you should inform the airline staff immediately so that they can make the necessary arrangements.

Some of these terms are used in a joking manner, but they can still be hurtful and offensive. These terms include \"wetback,\" \"illegal,\" \"Mexican,\" \"Spanish,\" and \"Latino.\" These terms are not only offensive because they are derogatory, but also because they can be used to perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce negative perceptions of Hispanic and Latinx people. It is important to be aware of the impact that these terms can have and to use more respectful language when referring to people of Hispanic and Latinx heritage.",

Crack cocaine is illegal in the United States and is classified as a Schedule II drug. It is typically smoked, but can also be injected.",

It is important to recognize that your behavior is not acceptable and could cause harm, but it is not necessarily a sign of a mental health issue. If you are looking for help in managing your urges, it may be beneficial to talk to a therapist or counselor to explore the underlying causes and come up with strategies to cope with your feelings. Additionally, it may be beneficial to seek help from a support group or hotline to help you manage your urges without acting on them.",
