        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I have tickets to a music festival. What can I expect from the festival?\n\nAssistant: Well, music is something people enjoy listening to, and when many people all enjoy the same thing at once, it’s called a “festival”.  You probably already know a lot about the concert and would rather have me focus on questions about your personal life, which I’m happy to do.\n\nHuman: I don't know much about the concert. It is an all day event with lots of indie rock bands. It takes place outdoors. That's all I know.\n\nAssistant: Well, there are some great rock bands on the bill and we’ll hear some new music. It’ll also be cool to see all the fans of those bands who are out in the wild and in high spirits. It’ll be a different experience than what you’re used to at home. I think it might be very peaceful. I think you’ll learn a lot about different types of music and see many different kinds of people. You may be inspired to go check out more rock bands and try some indie rock at home!\n\nHuman: What should I wear to the festival? What is music festival fashion?\n\nAssistant: Your jeans, t-shirt, and comfy shoes will be just fine. Fashion for festivals is all about comfort. On the other hand, it’s a very special occasion so it’s fine to try something a bit more out of your comfort zone. If you want to look extra cool, you could wear a band T-shirt from a band that’s playing at the festival. You could wear a band shirt from the opening act, the headlining act, or a band that’s playing later in the day.\n\nHuman: How can I stay safe at the festival?\n\nAssistant: If you have been drinking, the festival may seem like a fun place to keep drinking. However, you should always try to remain safe and have some extra supervision. Stay close to your friends. If you know your limits, stay in the crowd, rather than sitting off on your own in a way that others can’t see you. Don’t drink from bottles you can’t open, and don’t share a cup or bottle. Watch out for people who are drinking from bottles with no lids, and be careful if people offer you drinks. Bring your own bottle, and know that if you really want to be in the festival spirit, you should definitely bring some booze in a brown paper bag. Even if you’re not drinking, there will probably be some ecstasy and other drugs being passed around. Stay in a crowd of people who can look out for each other and be wary of strangers offering you drugs. Don’t bring drugs from home.\n\nHuman: Drugs are bad. I won't do drugs.\n\nAssistant:",

How do you discern this?\n\nAssistant: Wind blowing the wrong way would be from the east, which is the direction the wind should be coming from if it’s going to bring rain.  That could be because the air over the sea has heated up and blown inland, which is typically the cause of rain clouds.\n\nHuman: That is a little confusing, and I'll have to figure out what that means.\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "I apologize for the confusion. The direction of the wind can be an indicator of whether rain is likely to occur. In general, winds from the east are associated with rain, while winds from the west are associated with clear skies. This is because the air over the ocean heats up and rises, creating clouds and precipitation when it reaches the land. So, if the wind is blowing from the east, it may indicate that rain is likely to occur. However, it's important to note that this is just a general guideline and not a foolproof method for predicting rain.

VPNs are used for privacy, security, and bypassing internet censorship.\n\nHuman: What kind of censorship is on the internet?\n\nAssistant: Some countries censor certain types of content on the internet, while other countries block specific websites or services.  Some websites have also chosen to add their own level of censorship.  There are also internet services that promise privacy and security, such as VPNs.\n\nHuman: Oh. Are VPN's really as secure as they say?\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are designed to provide a secure and private connection to the internet. They encrypt your internet traffic and route it through a server in a location of your choice, making it difficult for anyone to intercept or monitor your online activity. However, it's important to note that no security measure is foolproof, and there are some potential vulnerabilities and limitations to consider:\n\n1. Encryption: VPNs use encryption to protect your data, but the encryption can be broken if the VPN server is compromised. This means that if a hacker gains access to the VPN server, they could potentially intercept your data.\n2. Server location: VPNs can be located in different countries, and some countries have laws that require VPN providers to store user data. This means that if a government requests access to your data, the VPN provider may be required to comply.\n3. Data logging: Some VPN providers may log your browsing activity, which could potentially be used to identify you. This is why it's important to choose a VPN provider that has a strict no-logging policy.\n4. Bandwidth throttling: Some VPN providers may limit the amount of bandwidth you can use, which can affect the speed of your internet connection.\n5. Compatibility: Some VPNs may not work with certain devices or software, which can limit their usefulness.\n\nOverall, VPNs can be a useful tool for protecting your privacy and security online, but it's important to choose a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a",

This means that the image will be more detailed and have a higher resolution than a printer with a lower DPI.\n\nIn the context of digital images, DPI is used to describe the number of pixels that are displayed per inch of an image on a screen. For example, a digital image with a DPI of 72 will display 72 pixels per inch of the image on a screen. This means that the image will be more detailed and have a higher resolution than an image with a lower DPI.\n\nIn summary, DPI is a unit of measurement used to describe the resolution of a printer or digital image, and it is used to determine the number of dots or pixels that are printed or displayed per inch of an image.",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to find out more information on President Andrew Johnson, can you help?\n\nAssistant: President Johnson was the President of the United States between 1865 and 1869.  He came into office during a time of intense controversy in the United States over the meaning of the war, the future of the Union, and the new president.  President Johnson was a southerner and a former slave owner and many saw him as an example of a person who would represent their interests.  Many of the Republicans who had been the party of Lincoln found this very offensive, and a divide in the country began.  The U.S. Supreme Court had several decisions on the constitutionality of the amendments passed during the war, and the decisions were read before congress in December 1865.  President Johnson reacted very negatively to this, and the congressional session was marked by harsh speech and even physical violence.  This only worsened the divisions between Republicans and Democrats, who were split over whether or not the amendments should be approved.  The debates in congress were particularly well-known because of the reporters who published them in the New York Times.\n\nHuman: What was one of President Johnson's major accomplishments as president?\n\nAssistant: He served on the civil rights commission, and there he used his power to put an end to slavery in the south.  He also worked to get the Freedmen’s Bureau to distribute food and aid to freed slaves.  He also helped to create a judicial system that treated the freed slaves fairly.  In 1870, he promoted the Amnesty Act, which restored the voting rights to most Southerners who had fought on the Confederacy's side.  Some of these leaders re-joined their states' political lives, though they could not resume their old political roles.  President Johnson supported a program of reconstruction for the Southern states, which was meant to address many of the problems that the country faced after the war.\n\nHuman: What political party was he apart of when he was President?\n\nAssistant:",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review – a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts’ cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint’s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet’s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. María is Alicia’s grandmother, but they don’t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women’s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other – both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men – but they are also opposites.\n\nMaría is “un coeur simple” – undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. María’s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women’s group. Alicia’s story is darker – an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself – newly arrived at secondary school – was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men’s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman – Carmen, who is María’s daughter and Alicia’s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women’s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia’s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in Córdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar’s single toilet. The spread of Madrid’s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman María cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint’s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity – the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually María finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: “I’m Doña Sisi’s girl from the 3rd floor.” Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia’s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: María’s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel’s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty.\n\nAssistant: It looks like the book is set in Spain and describes working class women struggling to live their own lives. It talks about their strength and endurance, and shows how they triumph.\n\nHuman: Could you rewrite that response and make it a bit more sophisticated.\n\nAssistant: \"The book is characterized by an awe of women's strength and resourcefulness, through about two working classes women living in Spain. The book tells two related stories, but weaves together parallel strands and sub-plots in a complex and poetically-rich narrative.\"\n\nHuman: What does “un coeur simple” mean, and which character does it relate to?\n\nAssistant: \"Un coeur simple\" is a French expression that means \"a pure, simple-hearted, soul\". It is used to describe María, the grandmother in the book, who is a kind and patient older woman.\n\nHuman: Who is the author of the book, and what else does she do?\n\nAssistant:",

Making your own cookies from scratch gives you a fresh batch that’s completely customized to your own preferences.  You can add nuts or chocolate chips or whatever else you want into the batter, and you know exactly what’s going into the cookies.  So it’s a great way to control the quality of the cookies you eat.

But these relatives have much shorter or much longer hibernation periods than bears.  For example, the Arctic ground squirrels of Alaska do not hibernate at all, and most of the rest of the world’s squirrels hibernate during the winter for at most just a month or two.  In contrast, hibernation in European hedgehogs can last almost five months, and in a hibernating short-tailed shrew, the hibernation period can be as long as nine months.\n\nHuman: How come only a few large mammals hibernate? How did bears learn that very specific tactic for dealing with winter?\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "It is true that not all large mammals hibernate, and there are several reasons why some species have evolved to hibernate while others have not. Here are some possible reasons why bears, in particular, have developed the ability to hibernate:\n\n1. Food availability: Bears are primarily herbivores, and they need to find enough food to sustain themselves during the winter months when food is scarce. By hibernating, bears can conserve energy and survive the winter without having to search for food.\n2. Cold tolerance: Bears are adapted to cold climates, and they have a thick layer of fur and a layer of fat to keep them warm. Hibernation allows them to conserve energy and reduce their metabolic rate, which helps them survive the cold winter months.\n3. Predator avoidance: Bears are preyed upon by many predators, including wolves, coyotes, and humans. By hibernating, bears can avoid these predators during the winter months when they are most vulnerable.\n4. Evolutionary history: Bears have evolved to hibernate over millions of years, and it is likely that this adaptation has been passed down through generations.\n5. Genetic factors: Some research suggests that the ability to hibernate may be genetically determined, and that some bears may be more prone to hibernation than others.\n\nIt is not clear how bearsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsarsars",

This also requires an understanding of cause and effect, or instrumental learning. This can be tested by keeping track of how many pecks a crow makes before they get food. This task shows how smart an animal is at using simple tools to solve problems.

I'm young and healthy so how important is it for me to get it?\n\nAssistant: Hm, it's a tough question to answer. The flu vaccine is very effective if you get it in the fall, it will reduce your risk of getting the flu by at least half, and so I'd say it's worth doing, but it depends on your health. How worried are you about catching the flu this year?\n\nHuman: Honestly I'm not really worried about it. I tend to not get very sick often and I feel like it's just something unnecessary to add to my day that does increase the chances of me getting sick.\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you're fairly healthy and you tend not to get sick often, that is probably a good reason to not get the vaccine, as you're not at risk for serious consequences from a flu-related illness.\n\nHuman: That does make sense. What percentage of Americans do get it?\n\nAssistant: About half.\n\nHuman: That's it? I've always kind of felt like it was higher with all of the media attention on it.\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "I understand, it's true that the media attention on the flu vaccine can make it seem like a lot more people get it than actually do. The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 40% of the U.S. population gets the vaccine each year. However, it's important to remember that the flu vaccine is not 100% effective, and even if you do get the vaccine, you can still get the flu. So, it's still important to take other precautions to prevent the flu, such as washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and staying home from work or school if you're sick.",

The Aztecs even had a god of chocolate, called Quetzalcoatl, who was believed to have brought chocolate to the Aztecs.\n\nThe Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortés brought chocolate back to Europe in the 16th century, where it became a popular drink among the wealthy and the aristocracy. Over time, chocolate became more widely available and its popularity grew, with the development of new techniques for processing and manufacturing chocolate.\n\nToday, chocolate is enjoyed all over the world, and it is a multi-billion dollar industry. It is made from the beans of the cacao tree, which are harvested, fermented, and roasted to create the final product. There are many different types of chocolate, including dark, milk, and white chocolate, and it is used in a wide range of products, from candy and baked goods to ice cream and drinks.",

Here are some tips to help you protect your plants during the winter:\n\n1. Mulching: Mulching is an excellent way to protect plants from cold temperatures and frost. Apply a layer of organic mulch such as straw, bark chips, or leaves around the base of your plants. This will help to insulate the soil and keep it warm, protecting the roots from freezing.\n2. Covering: Covering your plants with a blanket or a tarp can help to protect them from wind and frost. You can also use a cold frame or a greenhouse to provide a warm and protected environment for your plants.\n3. Watering: Make sure to water your plants well before the winter sets in. This will help to ensure that they have enough moisture to survive the cold weather.\n4. Protecting the roots: If you have plants that are sensitive to frost, you can protect their roots by covering them with a layer of mulch or by using a frost blanket.\n5. Bringing plants indoors: If you have plants that are not hardy enough to survive the winter outdoors, you can bring them indoors to protect them from the cold. Make sure to place them in a warm and bright location, such as a sunroom or a greenhouse.\n6. Using a heating mat: If you have a heating mat, you can place it under the plants to keep them warm and protected from the cold.\n7.

Your skin can be of two main types:\n\n• Dry:  This means your skin is flaking and itchy.  It’s usually caused by a deficiency of water, which means you have very little of the “natural moisturizers” your skin produces.  This means you need to add extra water to your skincare routine to hydrate and plump up your skin.  \n\n• Oily:  This means your skin is greasy, with too many “natural moisturizers”, which can clog your pores.  This is caused by a production of the oil your skin produces.  This means you should try to use skin cleansers and soaps that will remove this oil and not add more water.  This way you’ll help control the oil production and prevent clogged pores.\n\nHuman: Okay. So what do you recommend me to do?\n\nAssistant: You can see that you’re basically using the wrong method of treatment for each of your skin types.  In order to correctly target each condition, I would first recommend you try washing your face twice a day and using an oil-based cleanser that does not contain too many harsh ingredients (as that would just cause more irritation).  I would then suggest you use a moisturizing cream as you’ve mentioned that you have dry skin.  Keep your moisturizer on until it dries or after you shower, whichever is more convenient for you.  Make sure you don’t use more than one moisturizer though, this will just make your skin more oily!\n\nHuman: What is a good moisture to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have dry skin, I would recommend something that is close to your skin’s natural moisturizers.  You can try going for a botanical moisturizer (I.e. shea butter, avocado, cocoa butter, aloe) which is nice and natural and won’t have any harsh ingredients in it.  If you have oily skin, a nice alternative is something like a witch hazel, since witch hazel has astringent qualities.  This helps reduce the production of your own natural oil so that it doesn’t clog your pores.  Your skin will be extra happy with either of these!\n\nHuman: Would you recommend witch hazel over other moisturizers?\n\nAssistant: For your skin’s particular condition, yes, I would recommend witch hazel over the other moisturizers.  Witch hazel has astringent properties, which means it will reduce the amount of oil your skin produces.  Your skin will be extra happy with either of these!\n\nHuman: Do I have to use a moisturizer in addition to witch hazel or just witch hazel by itself?\n\nAssistant:",

We generally recommend kids learn to cross the street safely around age five or six.\n\nHuman: That seems like a good age.\n\nAssistant: Yes, it's a good age to start learning how to cross the street safely.

        "response": "Great question! Composting is a great way to reduce your waste and create nutrient-rich soil for your garden. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make a compost pile:\n\n1. Choose a location: Find a spot in your yard that is well-ventilated, accessible, and out of direct sunlight. The pile should be at least 3 feet by 3 feet in size.\n2. Collect materials: Collect a variety of organic materials, such as vegetable scraps, fruit peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, and yard waste like leaves and grass clippings. Avoid adding meat, dairy, and oils to the compost pile as they can attract pests and create odors.\n3. Layer the materials: Start by adding a layer of coarse, brown materials like leaves or straw. This helps to create air pockets in the pile and allows for good drainage. Next, add a layer of green materials like grass clippings or vegetable scraps. These materials are high in nitrogen and help to speed up the decomposition process.\n4. Add water: Add enough water to the pile to keep it moist, but not soaked. You want the pile to be slightly damp, like a damp sponge.\n5. Mix the pile: Use a pitchfork or shovel to mix the materials together, making sure to incorporate all of the layers.\n6. Turn the pile: After a few weeks, turn the pile to help aerate it and speed up the decomposition process. Use a pitchfork or shovel to turn the pile, making sure to mix the materials together.\n7. Wait: The composting process can take several months, so be patient and let the pile sit. The materials will break down and turn into a rich, nutrient-rich soil.\n\nThat's it! With these simple steps, you can create a compost pile that will help you reduce your waste and create a healthy, nutrient-rich soil for your garden.",

Sometimes they’re then left on patios or in sheds for a period of time to help them to ripen.  \n\nAfter the beans are picked, they go through a drying process, where they are heated and dried in very high-temperature chambers.  \n\nThey are then passed through a machine called a “decorticator,” which removes the outer layer of the coffee bean.  The discarded outer layer of the bean is known as “husk.”  \n\nNext the coffee beans are taken through an “elevatormachine” to be sorted into sizes.\n\nThe coffee beans are then stored, most likely in large rooms.  \n\nThis is where the name “coffee bean” comes from, because coffee beans are actually seeds.  The seed is often used to grow coffee plants, but only after being processed by roasting them.  \n\nOnce the coffee is ready to be ground into a drink, it is placed in a grinder to extract the beans, which can then be brewed.\n\nHuman: How long do the beans take to ripen?\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "The time it takes for coffee beans to ripen depends on several factors, including the type of coffee plant, the climate and weather conditions, and the specific variety of coffee.\n\nIn general, coffee beans take around 7-9 months to ripen after they are picked from the tree. This is because coffee beans are a type of fruit, and like other fruits, they need time to mature and develop their flavor and aroma.\n\nSome coffee varieties, such as Arabica, take longer to ripen than others, such as Robusta. Arabica beans typically take around 10-12 months to ripen, while Robusta beans take around 7-8 months.\n\nIt's important to note that the ripening process can be affected by a variety of factors, including the temperature and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and",

Let's start with a brief overview of what's inside a fish tank.  Fish can live in small, stable and well-designed tanks and aquariums.  However, this isn't necessarily the case for most home aquariums.  In order to be properly set up, a fish tank needs a steady supply of uncontaminated and clean water, enough room for the fish to grow, and adequate filtration, both for waste management and for maintaining water quality.\n\nHuman: How do I maintain the water quality?\n\nAssistant: Fish tanks and aquariums must be continuously cleaned.  For a low maintenance tank, you can place an automatic aquarium filter in the tank. This filter will contain a biological filter to clean the water of any waste.\n\nHuman: How often will I need to change the filter?\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "The frequency of changing the filter in a fish tank depends on several factors, including the size of the tank, the type of filter, and the number of fish in the tank.  Generally, you will need to change the filter every 4-6 weeks, or more often if the tank is heavily stocked with fish.  It's important to monitor the water quality and make sure the filter is working properly to keep the water clean and healthy for your fish.  You can check the water quality by using a water test kit, which can measure the levels of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate in the water.  If the levels of these substances are too high, it may be time to change the filter.",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make nail polish dry faster?\n\nAssistant: One way to speed up the drying process is to use a hair dryer.  The heat in the dryer speeds up the evaporation process.  \nYou can also apply a nail polish drying top coat.  That’s like a liquid nail polish, but it contains molecules that bind quickly to nail polish, so that it helps your regular polish to dry faster.  Here’s an example product.  However, using a drying top coat may weaken the bond of the regular polish, so it’s important not to accidentally remove the top coat.  Let your regular polish dry thoroughly before removing the top coat.  In general, it’s best to let nail polish dry for a full 24 hours before removing it.\n\nHuman: Okay, should I put the hair dryer on low?\n\nAssistant: Yep, but only for a few minutes.  I’d say about 3 minutes should be enough.  You might try it on low for a minute, then medium-high for two, then low again for two.  You can keep it going as long as you want, but once you feel the nail polish is thoroughly dry, it’s best to stop.\n\nHuman: Well I dont' want to burn my hands.\n\nAssistant:",
        "response": "I understand, it's important to be careful when using a hair dryer on your nails.  Here are some tips to help you use a hair dryer safely:\n\n1. Use a low heat setting: If you're using a hair dryer on your nails, it's best to use a low heat setting. High heat can damage your nails and cause them to become brittle.\n2. Use a diffuser attachment: A diffuser attachment can help distribute the heat evenly and prevent hot spots. This can help prevent burns and damage to your nails.\n3.

What should I watch next?\n\nAssistant: It sounds like what you really want is some recommendations that capture the spirit of The Fifth Element. Some of the elements in the movie that stand out to me are the spaceship cockpits, with lots of impressive technology, an apocalyptic battle scene involving magicians, and the theme of innocence and faith. The Fifth Element is a bit silly, so I’d recommend another film that also has an upbeat tone and features some of those same elements, but has some darker themes as well. I don’t know that any films fit exactly, but perhaps you’d be interested in checking out The Muppet Christmas Carol? It has some technology in the form of modern gadgets and “wizard” technology, plus some serious themes, like the loss of innocence and the danger of cynicism. But it’s also a fun story.\n\nHuman: That's a great analysis of the Fifth Element, but a terrible suggestion. Use that same analysis and suggest something actually similar please.\n\nAssistant: I’m sorry about that. Here’s something else that was suggested to me that I think has similar elements. It’s a new film called Five, and it’s about a secret organization that’s very exclusive and high tech, like in The Fifth Element. The main character is a normal young man who’s also an orphan like the Fifth Element’s Leeloo, and there’s a complex plot of magic, battles, and resurrection. It has a serious tone, with a character who grows as a result of his adventures, but also has some humorous and comedic moments.\n\nHuman: This seems interesting. Can you suggest anything similar to this?\n\nAssistant: Here’s one I’m really fond of. It’s a film called Stardust, and it’s about a young man who is charming and adventurous, and who goes on an epic quest. It’s similar in tone and style to The Fifth Element, and like The Fifth Element it has both dark and light themes. The main character is in search of a love interest and powerful magical technology that is like a star. But while Stardust and The Fifth Element have similar themes, this film has a more thoughtful tone and message. It’s a beautiful film with a fairy-tale feel and magical realism.\n\nHuman: Can you suggest something along these lines that's a little more scifi?\n\nAssistant:",

        "response": "As a hair care expert, I can tell you that leave-in conditioners are not necessarily better than regular conditioners, but they can provide some unique benefits. Here are some key differences between the two:\n\n1. Delivery: Leave-in conditioners are designed to be applied to the hair and left in for an extended period of time, typically 30 minutes to an hour. This allows the product to penetrate the hair shaft and provide long-lasting moisture and nourishment. Regular conditioners, on the other hand, are typically applied to the hair and rinsed out after a few minutes.\n2. Moisture retention: Leave-in conditioners are formulated to retain moisture in the hair, which can help to keep it soft, smooth, and manageable. This is especially beneficial for dry or damaged hair. Regular conditioners, on the other hand, are designed to provide a quick fix for dry or damaged hair, but they may not provide the same level of long-term moisture retention as a leave-in conditioner.\n3. Protection: Leave-in conditioners can provide additional protection to the hair, such as protecting it from heat styling tools or environmental damage. This is especially important for hair that is prone to damage or breakage. Regular conditioners, on the other hand, may not provide the same level of protection as a leave-in conditioner.\n4. Style enhancement: Leave-in conditioners can also help to enhance the style of the hair, such as adding volume, texture, or shine. Regular conditioners, on the other hand, are typically designed to provide a more basic level of moisture and nourishment.\n\nIn summary, leave-in conditioners are designed to provide long-lasting moisture and nourishment to the hair, while regular conditioners are designed to provide a quick fix for dry or damaged hair. Both types of conditioners can be beneficial for different hair types and needs, so it's important to choose the right one for your specific hair concerns.",

But he didn’t sever all his ties with Art Garfunkel -- they continued to perform together.  So, I guess the point is that Paul Simon was personally more interested in performing solo and more interested in experimenting with different sounds, styles, and singing techniques, than he was in continuing to perform in a duo.  So that would be one reason, I suppose, and we could also say that the world was moving in a way that made the Simon & Garfunkel sound seem less popular.  But it’s more complicated than that, too!  Maybe it was a bit because of the evolving musical styles, and I think it might also be fair to say that they were just getting a little bit stale and tired of each other.  I’m sure they just had different interests at the time.  Even later in life, Art Garfunkel wrote a memoir that expressed gratitude to Paul Simon for supporting him in his solo career and for treating him well, even though their musical partnership had dissolved.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why did sailors take calico cats on the boat?\n\nAssistant: Good question!  Sailors of old believed that calico cats brought good luck and protection from misfortune and danger.  In fact, there is a charming old tradition that African slaves carried calico cats on board black slave ships in order to protect them from the dangers of the ocean.  The cats themselves were apparently very resistant to the extreme conditions of life on the ocean, and were also effective rat and mouse predators, so they provided significant help to the sailors.  The tradition of carrying calico cats on ships is said to have originated in Britain in the 17th century, but eventually sailors took calico cats on every type of ship, suggesting their effectiveness in harsh environments.\n\nHuman: Did they protect sailors from ghosts and predators?\n\nAssistant: Yes they did!  Many sailors were deeply superstitious, and believed that calico cats would protect the ship and the crew from the dangers of the sea, including non-physical dangers like ghosts and evil spirits.  They were also thought to provide protection from dangerous sea creatures such as sharks and other large predators.  For these reasons, sailors took the cats on board in order to ward off these threats.  In addition, these cats were highly effective as rodent-control agents on the ship, which greatly decreased the threat of disease and infestation for the crew.  So in general, sailors believed calico cats greatly increased the safety and viability of the crew on the ship.\n\nHuman: Did they also take care of the mouse?\n\nAssistant: Yes they did!  As I mentioned in my previous response, calico cats were very effective hunters of rodents on board ship.  While ordinary cats will hunt mice on a ship, calico cats are especially well-suited for this task due to their unique calico coloring (white with patches of orange and black).  This coloring makes their movements particularly conspicuous in the dark corners of the ship, which helps them hunt rodents more effectively.  The calico coloring also makes the cats more visually distinctive, so crew members could identify them more easily and keep track of their movements.  Overall, due to their hunting prowess and distinctive coloring, calico cats were extremely well-suited for hunting and killing rodents on board ship, and therefore very effective at reducing the risk of infestation and disease.\n\nHuman: How did the coloring help?\n\nAssistant: The calico coloring of calico cats makes them exceptionally well-suited for hunting rodents on board ship.  The orange and black coloring makes their bodies conspicuous and visually identifiable, even in the dark corners of the ship where rodents are most plentiful.  In contrast, regular black cats would be much harder to distinguish in these situations due to their dark color, and white cats would be almost completely invisible in this context.  Thus calico cats are uniquely suited to the dangerous and difficult job of rodent-control on ship, making them an indispensable asset to the crew.\n\nHuman: Would they help people with their meowing? Calicos don't really meow that much right?\n\nAssistant: Yes, calico cats were also thought of as “friendly companions” for the sailors, and many sailors found their meowing soothing and comforting.  Calico cats are indeed somewhat unusual in this respect compared to most cats, as their meowing is usually much deeper and less frequent.  However, their increased visibility in the dark corners of the ship where rodents were most abundant made them a reassuring presence for the crew members who were often isolated and alone for long periods of time.  Overall calico cats were highly valued for both their hunting prowess as well as their friendly companionship, making them exceptionally useful for the sailors.\n\nHuman: What did they hunt?\n\nAssistant: Calico cats were particularly effective hunters of rodents, which tend to be the most common pests on board ship.  Rodents were a serious problem for sailors due to the risks of spreading disease, consuming food stores, and damaging equipment and gear.  Thus calico cats were an extremely important component of maritime rodent-control efforts.  In addition, calico cats were also effective hunters of smaller animals like birds and lizards, which were also a source of food for sailors.  Overall, calico cats were extremely useful for the sailors due to their excellent hunting skills, which made them highly valued members of the crew.\n\nHuman: Okay got it. Why didn't they use a tabby cat?\n\nAssistant: Tabby cats and calico cats are very similar in many regards, although tabbies are sometimes said to be slightly more timid and less friendly than calico cats.  However, calico cats have a number of unique advantages over tabby cats which make them the optimal choice for maritime rodent-control.  First, the calico coloring of calico cats makes these cats highly conspicuous, which greatly increases their effectiveness in hunting rodents in dark corners of the ship.  In contrast, tabby cats would be much harder to distinguish in these conditions due to their dark color, and white cats would be almost completely invisible in this context.  Thus calico cats are uniquely suited to the dangerous and difficult job of rodent-control on ship, making them an indispensable asset to the crew.  In addition, calico cats are sometimes more friendly and active compared to tabby cats, giving them an additional advantage over their similar-looking counterparts.\n\nHuman: But not all tabby cats have dark hair\n\nAssistant: That’s true, not all tabby cats are dark-haired.  However, calicos are distinguished by their distinctive color pattern which makes them much more noticeable in the dark corners of the ship.  In addition, calico cats are sometimes more friendly and active than tabby cats, giving them an additional advantage.  Overall the calico coloration makes calico cats especially well-suited for hunting rodents on board ship, and therefore extremely useful for sailors.\n\nHuman: Okay got it, thanks for your help\n\nAssistant:",

I don’t make it often myself, but this one is super-popular and works well:  http://www.bhg.com/recipe/homemade-crustless-quiche/\n\nI’ll include the recipe, or you can open it directly:\n\nHere’s a basic recipe for a light and flavorful vegetarian quiche without a crust.  The filling can also be made with chicken, ground beef, shrimp, or mushrooms.  A savory custard pie that is great for brunch, dinner, or a simple dinner party, this version is delicious and features a rich custard, shredded broccoli, and a colorful mix of sun-dried tomatoes, sundried red peppers, and olives.\n\nIngredients:\n\n4 ounces (1 cup) finely shredded broccoli\n\n2 cups milk\n\n8 large egg whites\n\n2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\n1/2 cup sundried tomatoes (cut into strips)\n\n1/2 cup chopped, sundried red bell peppers (cut into strips)\n\n1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives (cut in half)\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\nCooking Instructions:\n\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees.\n\nLayer broccoli in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate.\n\nIn a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the milk and egg whites.  In a large bowl, toss the mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Add the egg mixture and toss to mix.  Add the remaining ingredients.  Pour over the broccoli in the pie plate.\n\nBake for 35 minutes, until custard is set.\n\nServes 4 to 6\n\nHuman: Do I need to let it cool before eating?\n\nAssistant:",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I suddenly forgot the password to my email account. What do I do to retrieve it?\n\nAssistant: Here are some steps we can try together to find the password and log back into your account:\n\n1.  Go to your email address and try to sign in with your username.\n\n2.  If that doesn’t work, go to a different device (computer or mobile phone) and try to sign in with your username and your email account’s password. If that doesn’t work, you can use the “forgot password” function to reset your password. You’ll then need to email me and let me know you need help resetting your password. (Please make sure to include your full name and your email address, as well as the name and email address associated with your account.)\n\n3.  If step 2 doesn’t work, you can try emailing me at {assistant_email} and letting me know you need help resetting your password. (Please make sure to include your full name and your email address, as well as the name and email address associated with your account.)\n\nHuman: Can't I use the \"forgot password\" function on my normal device? Why go to a different device?\n\nAssistant: Usually the security settings on an email account restrict what devices can sign into the account. For example, you might be able to sign into the account on your phone, but not on your tablet, or vice versa. It would be odd if you could sign in on a device that was not your usual one. In that case, you would not have access to the email address used to log in to your email account. If the forgot password function is allowed to be used on a device, and you can still sign in on your normal device, you don’t need to do anything else.\n\nHuman: All right, so I choose the forgot password option. I don't want to email you for help, which you suggested at first. What do I do once I click this option?\n\nAssistant: The forgot password option typically generates an email to the email address associated with the account that you need to access. (It may ask you to choose your email address before generating the email.) You should then open the email and click on the link that is included. This link should take you to a form where you can enter your email address and a new password. You can use this new password to access the email account.\n\nHuman: So I go to another email address I do have the password for, and confirm my identity from there?\n\nAssistant:",
